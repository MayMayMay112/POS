## About this project
This project was created for training purposes to provide a way for employees to practice using an NewPos6 system without any impact to a running store environment. It is written in C# and is designed to read files from a NewPos6 FC POS register and simulate the User Interface to help employees become farmilar with the layout, before they are expected to use real in-store equipment.
As this project can dynamically read in register files, it will ultimately pull the latest copy from the local waystation if running on the local network. If the waystation cannot be found, it will prompt the user to provide the files themselves. Whenever there is a new update to all POS, the simulator should be able to pull a new local copy at any time.
